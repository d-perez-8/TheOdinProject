# Rock Paper Scissors Project  

In this project, I have learned how to use javascipt to create a rock paper scissor game. I also learned how to manipulate the DOM so there is a user interface on the web page. 

I found manipulating the DOM difficult, but I am looking forward to more practice with it. 

Features to add when revisiting:
- Disable button after the winner has been announced
- Reset button to replay the game
